                    Difference between SQL and NoSQL?

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p> SQL is the programming language used to interface with   relational
                        databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
                        tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs
                        that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

                        parties as JSON object. It is compact, readable and digitally
                        signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity
                        Provider(IdP).

                        JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
                        any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on
                        the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the
                        JavaScript programming language.

                        How NodeJS handle multiple client requests? NodeJS receives
                        multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS
                        is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has
                        its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests
                        and processes them.
